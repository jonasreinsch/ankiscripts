# ankidoublecolon

This script copies '˸˸' (two times the
MODIFIER LETTER RAISED COLON) to the Mac OS pasteboard so
that you can use it in [Anki](http://ankisrs.net).

In Anki, a sequence of two colons (::) is used as a special character sequence
for cloze deletions. If you need a double colon inside
a cloze deletion - e.g. for Perl Modules like Lingua::EN::Inflexion,
you could write that instead as Lingua˸˸EN˸˸Inflexion, i.e. by
using the similar looking Unicode character '˸'.

Inspired by this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/3wpecv/how_to_type_escape_in_anki/).
